    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Taboo online is a game that brings the <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Taboo(2000).PDF" target="_blank">classic Taboo game</a> to teams remotely. So, it is best played in a video call, such as Zoom.  You will need to talk to your teammates when it is your turn as the clue-giver!</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>You will choose to be on one of two teams. Try to make the team as even as possible.</p>
    <p>Teams will take turns either guessing or listening to the other team. The guessing team guesses the word, while the opposing team ensures that no taboo word is said.</p>
    <p>The team with the most points after the set amount the rounds wins!</p>

    <h3>Your turn</h3>
    <p>As the clue-giver, you will have to verbally describe the highlighted top word on the card without saying any of the taboo words.  In this example, you want your team to guess the word 'jog', but you cannot say the words jog, run, walk, fast, morning, or path.  You could say something like "A light sprint".</p>

    <h3>Guess</h3>
    <p>If one of your teammates is the clue-giver, you guess the word by typing into the text box.</p>

    <h3>Listen</h3>
    <p>For the opposing team, players need to listen to the clue-giver. If the clue-giver says any words on the list, the opposing team member clicks the 'Said it!' button.</p>
